              <p>
                Pure Pound is a consensus network that enables a new payment system, 
                which defines a completely different form of digital money. 
                It is the a 5th generation decentralized peer-to-peer payment network that is powered by 
                its users with no central authority or middle-men. From a user perspective, Pure Pound is 
                pretty much like cash, gold, and silver for the Internet. Pure Pound can also be seen as 
                the most prominent triple entry bookkeeping system in existence. PUP is a true global 
                innovation for the emerging markets.

              <p>
                Pure Pound is an application of the POUND Protocol. It is an implementation 
                of a concept called "cryptocurrency", which was first described in 1998 by 
                Wei Dai on the cypherpunks mailing list, suggesting the idea of a new form of
                 money that uses cryptography to control its creation and transactions, rather
                  than a central authority. It is inspired by the block-chain technology that powers 
                  the BTC network. The first Pure Pound specification and proof of concept was based 
                  in the 2009 open-source cryptography mailing list by Satoshi Nakamoto, called as the 
                  White Paper for Bitcoin. The crypto-community has since grown exponentially with many 
                  developers working on similar projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Iota, and the like.

              <h2 class="display-4">Who controls the Pure Pound network?</h2>
              <p>
                Nobody owns the Pure Pound network much like no one owns the technology behind e-mail. 
                Pure Pound is controlled by all Pure Pound users around the world.
                 While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in
                  the Pure Pound protocol because all users are free to choose what software
                   and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users
                    need to use software complying with the same rules. Pure Pound can only work 
                    correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and
                     developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.

              <h2 class="display-4">How does Pure Pound work?</h2>
              <p>
                From a user perspective, Pure Pound is nothing more than a mobile app or 
                computer program that provides a personal Pure Pound wallet and allows a user to 
                send and receive pure pounds with them. This is how Pure Pound works for most users. 
                Behind the scenes, the Pure Pound network is sharing a public ledger called the "APL". 
                This ledger contains every transaction ever processed, allowing a user's computer to 
                verify the validity of each transaction. The authenticity of each transaction is 
                protected by digital signatures anchored on the Cryptographic Hash Algorithm (CHA) 
                1024-bit hashing technology which was developed uniquely for PUP. This process corresponds 
                to the sending addresses, allowing all users to have full control over sending pounds from 
                their own Pure Pound addresses. In addition, anyone can process transactions using the computing 
                power of specialized hardware, with key focus on using mobile phones, and earn a 
                reward in pounds for this service. This is often called "mining" or "digital minting".

                Yes. There are a growing number of businesses and individuals using Pure Pound. 
                This includes brick-and-mortar businesses like restaurants, apartments, and law firms, 
                as well as popular online services. While Pure Pound remains a relatively new phenomenon, 
                it is growing fast and an incredible rate.

              <p>
                Pure Pound payments are easier to make than debit or credit card purchases, 
                and can be received without a merchant account. Payments are made from a wallet 
                application, either on your computer or smartphone, by entering the recipient's address, 
                the payment amount, and pressing send. To make it easier to enter a recipient's address, 
                many wallets can obtain the address by scanning a QR code or touching two phones together 
                with NFC technology. An off-line payment system is also being developed.
